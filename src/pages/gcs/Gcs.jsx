              Ground Control Systems (GCS) refers to an integrated rugged
              solution for controlling drones. Currently, we are developing our
              own ground control systems that will include software for
              monitoring and controlling drones remotely through computer
              systems which includes features like Hands On Throttle and Stick
              Compatibility, Extended Range, ADSB feature and a feature to
              control multiple drones/UAVâ€™s that essentially act as an ATC for
              the aerial systems.
