Interestingly, loitering munitions are also known as âsuicide dronesâ with offense as their main aim. The size of loitering munitions can range from as small as a model airplane to as long as a surfboard. ORNIO is a fixed-wing UAV and is powered by pusher propellers. It is able to stay airborne and cover a large area, loiter around targets and when a target is selected or detected it instantly attacks it.",
